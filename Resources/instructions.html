	<h3><b>Instructions:</b></h3>

<p>
    In this experiment you will be presented with prompts that you have to memorize. The prompts can either be full sentences or partial sentences. Once you have memorized the prompt, if the prompt was a full sentence, then you have to re-type the prompt. If the prompt was a partial sentence, you will have to re-type the prompt and also complete it. For example, if the prompt is a partial sentence like "My brother was happy that", then then correct form of completing the prompt is to type something like "My brother was happy that it was sunny outside." 
</p>

<p>
    You can re-read the prompt as many times as you need by clicking the "Read prompt again" button.  Once you finish typing the entire sentence, you will click on the "next prompt" button to move on to the next prompt. 
</p>


<p>
   When completing the sentences with partial prompts, be as quick as you can and write the first thing that comes to mind. The sentences you write should be grammatical, but you do not have to spend too much time coming up with plausible scenarios or writing very well-crafted sentences.For example when given a prompt like "The pirate who was drowning", it is perfectly okay to generate a sentence like "The pirate who was drowning liked cake".
