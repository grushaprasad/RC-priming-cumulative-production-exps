	You are now done with part 1 of the study. The next part consists of about 60 trials. On each trial you will see a string of letters. Your task is to
decide whether this is an existing English word or not. If you think it is an existing English word, use the <b>z</b> key to choose "yes". If you think it is not an existing English word, use the <b> m </b> key to choose "no".
If you are sure that the word exists, even though you don’t know its exact meaning, you may still
respond "yes". But if you are not sure if it is an existing word, you should respond "no". </p>

<p>
In this experiment, we use British English rather than American English spelling. For example:
"realise" instead of "realize"; "colour" instead of "color", and so on. Please don’t let this confuse you.
This experiment is not about detecting such subtle spelling differences anyway.
You have as much time as you like for each decision. This part of the experiment will take about 5 minutes. </p>
