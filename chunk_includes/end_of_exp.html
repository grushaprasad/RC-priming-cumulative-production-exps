    This experiment was a part of a group of experiments using <i> syntactic priming </i> to understand how people represent sentences. Linguistic theory predicts that certain sentences are more structurally similar than other sentences. We are interested in measuring whether people's representation of sentences reflect this similarity. To investigate this question, we measured whether people were more likely to produce sentences with a particular structure, if they previosuly produced similar sentences.
