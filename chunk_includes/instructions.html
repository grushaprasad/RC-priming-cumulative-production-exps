	<h3><b>Instructions:</b></h3>

<p>
    In this experiment you will be presented with prompts consisting of partial sentences and your task is to complete these sentences. When completing the sentence, you <b> do not </b> have to first re-type the prompt. You can just type in the completion. 
</p>

<p>
    For example, consider the following prompt: "My brother was happy that"
</p>

<p>

    <b> Correct form of completing the prompt: </b> it was sunny outside. <br>

    <b> Incorrect form of completing the prompt: </b> My brother was happy that it was sunny outside. 

    
</p>

<p>
    Once you finish typing the entire sentence, you will click on the "next prompt" button to move on to the next sentence. When completing the sentences, be as quick as you can and write the first thing that comes to mind. The sentences you write should be grammatical, but you do not have to spend too much time coming up with plausible scenarios or writing very well-crafted sentences.For example when given a prompt like "The pirate who was drowning", it is perfectly okay to generate a sentence like "The pirate who was drowning liked cake".

    <b> Remember: Do not spend too much time and write the first thing that comes to mind. </b>
